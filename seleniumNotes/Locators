- In Selenium, locators are used to identify and interact with elements on a web page — like buttons,
  input fields, links, etc. Choosing the right locator strategy is crucial for building robust, maintainable,
  and fast test automation.

- Locator Type:
  ID - By.id()
  name - By.name()
  class name - By.className()
  tag name- By.tagName()
  Link Text- By.linkText()
  Partial Link Text - By.partialLinkText()
  CSS Selector - By.cssSelector()
  XPath - By.xpath()

🧠 What Is XPath?
XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML/HTML document.
In Selenium, it helps locate elements based on their structure, attributes, or text content.

🧩 Types of XPath
1. Absolute XPath
- Starts from the root (html) and follows the full path.
- Fragile: breaks if the DOM structure changes.
/html/body/div[2]/form/input[1]


2. Relative XPath
- Starts from anywhere in the DOM using //
- More flexible and preferred in automation.
//input[@id='username']

XPath Axes (Advanced):
- Axes define directional relationships between nodes. Instead of just selecting elements by tag or
  attribute, you can move up, down, or sideways in the DOM tree.
  Axes let you navigate relative to a node:
Axis                | Description                                 | Example
--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
child               | Selects direct children of a node           | //div/child::p
descendant          | Selects all children, grandchildren, etc.   | //div/descendant::input
parent              | Selects the immediate parent                | //input[@id='email']/parent::div
ancestor            | Selects all ancestors up to the root        | //input/ancestor::form
following           | All nodes after the current node            | //label[text()='Email']/following::input[1]
preceding           | All nodes before the current node           | //input[@id='password']/preceding::label[1]
following-sibling   | Siblings after the current node             | //h2/following-sibling::p
preceding-sibling   | Siblings before the current node            | //p/preceding-sibling::h2
self                | The current node itself                     | //input[@id='username']/self::input
descendant-or-self  | The node and all its descendants            | //div[@id='main']/descendant-or-self::input
