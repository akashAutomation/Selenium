- Cucumber is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework that allows you to write test cases in
  plain English using a language called Gherkin. It bridges the gap between technical and non-technical
  stakeholders by making test scenarios readable and understandable by everyone involved in the development process.

- Cucumber keywords:
| Keyword           | Purpose                                                                 | Example Usage                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Feature           | Describes the high-level functionality being tested                     | Feature: User login functionality                  |
| Scenario          | Defines a specific test case or user behavior                           | Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials  |
| Given             | Sets up initial context or preconditions                                | Given the user is on the login page                |
| When              | Describes the action or event                                           | When the user enters valid credentials             |
| Then              | Specifies the expected outcome                                          | Then the user should be redirected to dashboard    |
| And               | Adds additional steps to Given, When, or Then                           | And the user clicks the login button               |
| But               | Adds a negative or contrasting step                                     | But the password field is empty                    |
| Background        | Defines common steps that run before each scenario in the feature       | Background: Given the user is logged in            |
| Scenario Outline  | Enables parameterized scenarios with examples                           | Scenario Outline: Login with <username>            |
| Examples          | Provides data table for Scenario Outline placeholders                   | | username | password |                            |
| Rule              | Groups related scenarios under a business rule (optional, advanced)     | Rule: Password must be at least 8 characters       |
| #                 | Comment line (ignored by Cucumber)                                      | # This scenario tests login failure                |

Cucumber hooks:
- Cucumber hooks are special blocks of code that run before or after scenarios, steps, or features to manage setup,
  teardown, logging, and more. They help reduce code duplication and centralize test lifecycle logic.

| Hook Type             | Annotation       | When It Runs                                | Use Case Example                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Before                | @Before          | Before each scenario                         | Launch browser, initialize WebDriver, set test data    |
| After                 | @After           | After each scenario                          | Quit browser, capture screenshot on failure            |
| BeforeStep            | @BeforeStep      | Before each step in a scenario               | Log step start, set up preconditions                   |
| AfterStep             | @AfterStep       | After each step in a scenario                | Log step result, capture screenshot on failure         |
| BeforeAll (Java 8+)   | @BeforeAll       | Once before all scenarios (static method)    | Global setup like DB connection or config loading      |
| AfterAll (Java 8+)    | @AfterAll        | Once after all scenarios (static method)     | Global teardown like closing DB or flushing reports    |


| Exception Type                     | Description                                                                 | Typical Cause                                           |

| UndefinedStepException            | Step in feature file has no matching definition                            | Missing or misnamed step definition                     |
| AmbiguousStepException            | Multiple step definitions match a single step                              | Overlapping regex or duplicate step definitions         |
| CucumberException                 | Generic Cucumber error                                                      | Misconfigured runner, glue paths, or feature files      |
| MissingStepDefinitionException    | Step definition not found during dry run                                   | Step not implemented or glue path incorrect             |
| DuplicateStepDefinitionException  | Same step defined more than once                                            | Copy-paste errors or overlapping regex                  |

- Supports logical filtering (@login and not @slow).
