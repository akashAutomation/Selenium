- Maven is a powerful build automation and project management tool for Java-based applications. It simplifies
  compiling, testing, packaging, and managing dependencies using a standardized approach.

Maven is an open-source tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It uses an XML file called pom.xml (Project Object Model) to manage:
- Project structure
- Dependencies
- Build lifecycle
- Plugins and goals
- Reporting and documentation
Instead of writing custom build scripts (like in Ant), Maven follows a convention-over-configuration philosophy, reducing boilerplate and setup time.
