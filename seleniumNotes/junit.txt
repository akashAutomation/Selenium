🧪 What Is JUnit?
- JUnit stands for Java Unit Testing.
- JUnit is a widely used open-source testing framework for Java that helps developers write and run unit tests
  efficiently. It ensures that individual components of your code behave as expected.

🔍 Purpose of JUnit
- Unit testing means testing the smallest testable parts of an application (usually methods).
- JUnit helps you:
- Verify correctness of code
- Catch bugs early
- Automate regression testing
- Improve code quality and maintainability

⚖️ JUnit vs TestNG: Feature Comparison
| Feature                        | JUnit (especially JUnit 5)                   | TestNG                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Origin                        | Open-source, part of xUnit family            | Inspired by JUnit, stands for "Next Gen"    |
| Annotations                   | `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, etc.   | `@Test`, `@BeforeMethod`, `@AfterClass`, etc. |
| Parameterized Tests           | Supported in JUnit 5                         | Supported with `@DataProvider`              |
| Test Grouping                 | Limited (via tags in JUnit 5)                | Strong support using `groups`               |
| Parallel Execution            | Limited, requires external config            | Built-in support                            |
| Dependency Between Tests      | Not supported                                | Supported via `dependsOnMethods`            |
| Suite Execution               | Via test runners or Maven                    | Via XML suite files                         |
| Exception Testing             | `assertThrows()` in JUnit 5                  | `expectedExceptions` in `@Test`             |
| Timeout Handling              | `@Timeout` in JUnit 5                        | `timeOut` attribute in `@Test`              |
| IDE & Build Tool Integration  | Excellent (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Maven, Gradle) | Excellent                                   |
| Community & Ecosystem         | Larger, more mature                         | Smaller but active                          |

🧠 When to Use What?
- Use JUnit if:
- You want simplicity and wide community support.
- You're using modern Java (JUnit 5 is modular and powerful).
- You're integrating with tools that expect JUnit (e.g., Spring Boot, Android).

- Use TestNG if:
- You need advanced test configuration (e.g., dependencies, groups).
- You want built-in parallel execution.
- You prefer XML-based suite management.
