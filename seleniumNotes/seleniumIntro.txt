Selenium is a popular open-source framework used to automate web browsers for testing web applications
across different platforms and browsers.

🧪 What Selenium Does
- Automates browser actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages, and verifying content.
- Used primarily for functional testing, regression testing, and cross-browser compatibility.
- Supports multiple programming languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, and more.
    - selenium-java for Java
    - selenium-python for Python
    - selenium-webdriver for JavaScript (Node.js)


🧰 Selenium Tool Suite
Selenium is not a single tool — it’s a suite of components:
1. Selenium WebDriver --> Core API to automate browsers using code
2. Selenium IDE --> Browser extension for record-and-playback testing
3. Selenium Grid --> Runs tests in parallel across multiple machines/browsers
4. Selenium RC (deprecated) --> Legacy tool replaced by WebDriver

🌐 Browser & Platform Support
- Works with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux
- Can run tests locally or remotely (e.g., Selenium Grid, cloud services like BrowserStack)

✅ Why Use Selenium?
- Free and open-source
- Language flexibility (Java, Python, etc.)
- Cross-browser testing
- CI/CD integration (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Scalable with frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber

⚠️ Limitations
- Only automates web applications (not desktop or mobile apps natively)
- Requires programming knowledge
- No built-in reporting — needs integration with tools like ExtentReports or Allure

🔁 Selenium WebDriver Workflow
Here’s how a typical Selenium WebDriver test executes:
1. Test Script Execution
    - You write a test using Selenium APIs in your preferred language.
    - Example: driver.findElement(By.id("login")).click();
2. Command Translation
    - The Selenium binding converts your command into a JSON payload.
3. Protocol Communication
    - This payload is sent via HTTP to the browser driver (e.g., chromedriver.exe).
4. Driver Interpretation
    - The browser driver receives the command and translates it into native browser instructions using
      the browser’s automation engine (e.g., Chrome DevTools Protocol).
5. Browser Action
    - The browser performs the requested action (e.g., clicking a button, navigating to a URL).
6. Response Handling
    - The browser driver sends a response back to the client (e.g., success, failure, element not found).
7. Result Processing
    - Your test script processes the result and continues with the next command.

Page Object Model (POM):
The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern in Selenium test automation that promotes modularity,
maintainability, and reusability by separating the page structure (UI elements) from the test logic.
