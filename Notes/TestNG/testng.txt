 👉 TestNG:
- It is an open source automated TestNG framework. In TestNG, NG stands for "Next Generation".
- TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit.
- It is for the Java programming language.
- It covers a broader range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.

👉 Advantages --> 1. TestNG provides HTML reports by default for test execution. You can even add your own custom reports when required.
				   2. Annotations made testers life easy
				   3. Test cases can be Grouped & Prioritized more easily
                   4. Parallel testing is possible
                   5. Generates Logs
                   6. Data Parameterization is possible --> This feature allows you to pass the arguments as parameters and this achieved by using @Parameters annotation
                   7. To achieve the data-driven testing, DataProvider feature is used.
                   8. It allows to define dependency of one test method over other method.


👉 TestNG Annotations --> 1. TestNG annotations are the code that is written inside your source test code logic to control the flow of the execution of tests.
  						 2.	It is essential to annotate your methods in TestNG to run the tests.
  						 3.	TestNG will ignore the method which does not contain an annotation since it won't know when to execute this method.
						 4.	A TestNG annotation starts from the symbol "@".

  Types of TestNG Annotations -->
  		1. @BeforeSuite - Runs once before all tests in the suite. Ideal for setting up global configurations
		2. @AfterSuite - Runs once after all tests in the suite. Used for cleanup.
		3. @BeforeTest - Runs once before any test methods in the <test> tag of your XML suite(testng.xml).Runs once per <test> tag, not per class or method.
		4. @AfterTest - Runs after all test methods in the <test> tag.
		5. @BeforeClass - Runs once before the first method in the current class. Great for initializing shared resources.
		6. @AfterClass - Runs once after all methods in the current class.
		7. @BeforeMethod - Runs before each @Test method. Ideal for resetting test state.
		8. @AfterMethod - Runs after each @Test method. Useful for cleanup between tests.
		9. @BeforeGroups - The @BeforeGroups annotated method run only once for a group before the execution of all test cases belonging to that group.
		10. @AfterGroups - The @AfterGroups annotated method run only once for a group after the execution of all test cases belonging to that group.
		11. @Test - Runs a test method. You can add attributes like priority, dependsOnMethods, enabled, etc.
		12. @DataProvider - Supplies data to a test method. Enables data-driven testing.
		13. @Parameters	- Injects parameters from your XML suite file
		14. @Listeners- Attaches custom listeners for logging, reporting, etc.

		<suite name="MySuite">
            <test name="LoginTests">
                <classes>
                    <class name="com.demo.LoginTest"/>
                    <class name="com.demo.DashboardTest"/>
                </classes>
            </test>
        </suite>


  Hierarchy of the TestNG Annotations:
   		1. @BeforeSuite
		2. @BeforeTest
		3. @BeforeClass
		4. @BeforeMethod
		5. @Test
		6. @AfterMethod
		7. @AfterClass
		8. @AfterTest
		9. @AfterSuite

👉 Importance Of testng.xml file --> In a selenium testng project, we use testng.xml file to configure the complete test suite in a single file.
 									It is a heart of testng framework. This is also called runner file. Some features are:

  									1. It allows to include or exclude the execution of test methods and test groups.
  									2. It allows pass parameters to the test cases
  									3. Allows to add group dependencies
  									4. Allows to add priorities to the test cases
  									5. Allows to configure parallel execution of test cases.
  									6. Allows to parameterize the test cases.

👉 TestNG Assertions --> Assert is a class in TestNG.TestNG assertions helps us to verify the condition of the test in the middle of the test run. Based on the TestNG
  						assertions, we will consider a successful test only it is completed the test run without throwing any exception.
  						Some of the common assertions are:
  						1. assertEquals(String actual, String expected)
  						2. assertEquals(String actual, String expected, String message)
  						3. assertEquals(boolean actual, boolean expected)
  						4. assertEquals(boolean actual, boolean expected, String message)
  						5. assertTrue(boolean condition)
             			5. assertTrue(boolean condition, String message)
             			5. assertFalse(boolean condition)
             			5. assertFalse(boolean condition, String message)

  Soft Assert --> Soft Assert collects error during @Test.Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and would continue
  				  with the next step after the assert statement.
  		          If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the
  				  @Test and test suite again continue with the next @Test as it is.

  Hard Assert --> Hard Assert throws an AssertException immediately when an assert statement fails and test suite continue with
  				  the next @Test.


👉 Exception in TestNG --> TestNG gives an option for tracing the exception handling of code. You can verify whether a code
  							   throws the expected exception or not. The expected exception to validate while running the test case
  							   is mentioned using the expectedExceptions attribute value along with @Test annotations

  Q. How Can  we create data driven framework using TestNG?
  A. By using @DataProvider annotation.

  Q. How to run test cases in parallel using testng?
  A. We can use "parallel" attribute in testng.xml
  	 The "parallel" attribute of suite tag can accept 4 values:
  	 	1. tests --> All the test cases inside <test> tag of testng.xml file will run parallel.
  	 	2. classes --> All the test cases inside a java class will run parallel.
  	 	3. methods --> All the methods with @Test annotation will execute parallel
  	 	4. instances --> Test cases in same instance will execute parallel but two methods of two different instances will run in different thread.

  Q. verbose in testng.xml
  A. 1. you will get more detailed console output of you test cases.
     2. If you keep increasing the value of verbose, you will get more detailed console output of you test cases.
     3. you can give only 0-10 count in verbose. 0 will give basic output, 10 will give more detailed output

👉 Thread-count-->
  1. The thread-count attribute in TestNG controls how many threads will be used to run your tests in parallel.
  2. Minimum: 1
     - A value of 0 is invalid and will cause TestNG to ignore parallel execution or throw an error.
     Maximum: There’s no hard upper limit, but it depends on:
     - Your CPU core count
     - Memory availability
     - Browser driver stability (e.g., too many Chrome instances can crash your system)
