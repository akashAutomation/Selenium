👉 Selenium exceptions are runtime errors that occur during test execution, often due to issues with element interaction, timing, or browser state. Understanding and handling them is key to building robust automation frameworks.
Here’s a breakdown of the most common Selenium exceptions and how to handle them effectively:

👉 Top Selenium WebDriver Exceptions
| Exception Name                     | Description                                      | Common Cause                                      |

| StaleElementReferenceException    | Element is no longer attached to the DOM         | DOM updated after locating the element            |
| ElementNotVisibleException        | Element exists but is not visible                | Hidden due to CSS or dynamic rendering            |
| ElementNotInteractableException   | Element cannot be interacted with                | Disabled or obscured element                      |
| InvalidSelectorException          | Selector used is invalid                         | Syntax error in XPath or CSS                      |
| WebDriverException                | General error from WebDriver                     | Browser crash, session issues                     |
| NoSuchWindowException             | Target window not found                          | Window closed or not switched correctly           |
| NoSuchFrameException              | Frame not found                                  | Incorrect frame name or index                     |
| MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException    | Target location is outside viewport              | Trying to move to an off-screen element           |


👉 What Is StaleElementReferenceException?
This exception occurs when a WebElement you previously located becomes detached from the DOM. Selenium throws it when you try to interact with an element that is no longer valid due to a DOM refresh or update.
Typical causes:
- Page reloads or AJAX calls that re-render parts of the DOM.
- Navigating to a new page or frame.
- JavaScript dynamically replaces the element.
- Implicit or explicit waits that outlive the element’s lifecycle.

How to Fix or Avoid It:
Here are proven strategies to handle it:
1. Re-locate the element before interaction
2. Use ExpectedConditions.refreshed() with WebDriverWait
   WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
   WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.refreshed(
       ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("submit"))
   ));
   element.click();
3. Wrap interaction in a retry loop
4. Avoid storing WebElement references across page transitions --> Instead, store locators and re-fetch elements when needed.
