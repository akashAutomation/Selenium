👉 Create Extent Report Manager
    Utility class to initialize Extent:

Why Do We Need an Extent Report Manager?
- Extent Reports requires initialization before you can log anything.
- If you initialize it inside every test or hook, you’ll end up with duplicate code and possibly multiple report files.
- A singleton utility class (ExtentManager) ensures:
    - Only one ExtentReports object is created for the entire test run.
    - Centralized configuration (report name, system info, theme).
    - Easy reuse across hooks, step definitions, or listeners.


👉 ExtentService vs ExtentReports
- If You’re using ExtentService (from ExtentReports v5) instead of manually creating an ExtentReports object.
- ExtentService is a singleton service that manages the lifecycle of ExtentReports internally.
- The static block ensures that as soon as ReportManager is loaded, system info is added to the report.
So yes — this is valid and correct usage if you’re relying on Extent’s built‑in service layer.

⚡ Key Points to Know

- ExtentReports → you manually create and flush reports.
- ExtentService → Extent manages reports automatically (especially useful with Cucumber/TestNG plugins).
- System Info
    - Your code correctly sets metadata like Browser, Environment, and Author.
    - This info will appear in the report header.
- When to Use
    - If you’re running with Cucumber plugins (plugin = {"com.aventstack.extentreports.cucumber.adapter.ExtentCucumberAdapter:"} in your runner), then ExtentService is the right approach.
    - If you’re using plain Selenium/TestNG without the adapter, you’d typically use ExtentReports + ExtentSparkReporter instead.

👉 Steps to Integrate Extent Reports with Cucumber Runner
1. Add the Adapter Dependency
In your pom.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>tech.grasshopper</groupId>
    <artifactId>extentreports-cucumber7-adapter</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.0</version> <!-- use latest -->
</dependency>

2. Configure ReportManager
Your ReportManager with ExtentService is correct — it sets system info globally:

import com.aventstack.extentreports.service.ExtentService;

public class ReportManager {
    static {
        ExtentService.getInstance().setSystemInfo("Browser", "Chrome");
        ExtentService.getInstance().setSystemInfo("Environment", "QA");
        ExtentService.getInstance().setSystemInfo("Author", "Akash");
    }
}

3. Update Cucumber Runner
In your runner class, add the Extent adapter plugin:

@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources/features",
    glue = {"stepdefs","hooks"},
    plugin = {
        "pretty",
        "com.aventstack.extentreports.cucumber.adapter.ExtentCucumberAdapter:"
    }
)

4. Configure Report Output
Create a file extent.properties in your src/test/resources folder:

extent.reporter.spark.start=true
extent.reporter.spark.out=target/ExtentReport.html
extent.reporter.spark.config=src/test/resources/spark-config.xml


⚡ How It Works
- The ExtentCucumberAdapter plugin automatically hooks into Cucumber’s lifecycle.
- Every scenario is logged into the Extent report without you writing extent.createTest() manually.
- Your ReportManager adds system info globally.
- Reports are generated in target/ExtentReport.html after execution

👉 Recruiter‑Ready Talking Point
"I integrated Extent Reports with Cucumber using the ExtentCucumberAdapter plugin. This way, every scenario is
automatically logged into a professional HTML report. I centralized system info in a ReportManager class,
and customized styling via extent.propertiesl. This produces clean, reusable reports without extra code in step definitions.”
