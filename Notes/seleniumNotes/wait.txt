👉 Selenium provides three main types of waits: Implicit Wait, Explicit Wait, and Fluent Wait.
Each serves a different purpose for handling dynamic web elements and synchronization issues during test execution.

1. Implicit Wait
- What It Is:
    - Sets a default wait time for the WebDriver to poll the DOM when trying to find an element.
    - Syntax (Java): driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));

- Use Case:
    - Apply a global wait for all element lookups.
    - Useful when elements take a consistent time to appear.
    - Set once per session.
- Limitations:
    - Applies only to findElement and findElements.
    - Can cause unpredictable behavior when mixed with explicit waits.

2. Explicit Wait
- What It Is:
    - Waits for a specific condition to occur before proceeding (e.g., element to be clickable, visible, etc.).
    - Syntax (Java):
        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("submit")));

- Use Case:
    - When you need to wait for specific elements or conditions.
    - Ideal for dynamic content (e.g., AJAX-loaded elements).
    - More precise and controlled than implicit wait.
- Limitations:
    - Needs to be applied per element or condition.
    - Can be verbose if used repeatedly.

- Methods:
    elementToBeClickable(By locator) --> Waits until the element is visible and enabled for clicking
    elementToBeSelected(By locator) --> Waits until the element is selected
    invisibilityOfElementLocated(By locator) --> Waits until the element is not visible or not present in the DOM
    visibilityOfElementLocated(By locator) --> Waits until the element located by the selector is visible
    textToBe(By locator, String value) -->  Waits until the element’s text matches the given string
    textToBePresentInElementLocated(By locator, String text) --> Waits until the element contains the given text
    attributeToBe(By locator, String attribute, String value) --> Waits until the attribute equals the expected value
    alertIsPresent() --> Waits until a JavaScript alert is present
    frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt(By locator)  --> Waits for a frame to be available and switches to it
    titleIs(String title) --> Waits until the page title matches exactly
    urlToBe(String url) --> Waits until the current URL matches exactly




3. Fluent Wait
- What It Is:
    - An advanced form of explicit wait that allows:
        - Custom polling intervals
        - Exception handling
        - Custom conditions
    - Syntax (Java):
        Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
            .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(15))
            .pollingEvery(Duration.ofMillis(500))
            .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

        WebElement element = wait.until(driver -> driver.findElement(By.id("submit")));

- Use Case:
    - When elements appear at unpredictable intervals.
    - You want to fine-tune polling frequency and handle exceptions.
    - Useful for flaky or slow-loading elements.
- Limitations:
    - Slightly more complex to implement.
    - Overkill for simple waits.
