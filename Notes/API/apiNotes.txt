👉 What is API:
- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software
  applications to communicate with each other, exchange data, and perform functions without needing to know
  each other’s internal details.
- An API is like a contract between two systems. It defines how requests and responses should be structured.

Analogy: -
    Client: The one who makes the request(like browser, app)
    API: the middleman that passes the request to the server and brings back the response.
    Server: where all the processing happens(the backend)

Imagine a restaurant:
- You (the client) order food.
- The waiter (API) takes your request to the kitchen (server).
- The chef prepares the dish and gives it to the waiter.
- The waiter delivers it back to you.
 You don’t need to know how the kitchen works; the API handles the communication.

👉 How APIs Work
- Request: A client sends a request (e.g., “Give me user details”).
- Processing: The server interprets the request and fetches data.
- Response: The API returns the result in a structured format (often JSON or XML).
- Example (REST API in Postman):
    GET https://api.example.com/users/123
    Response:
    {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "abc",
      "email": "abc@example.com"
    }

👉 Why APIs Are Important
- Integration: Connects different systems (e.g., payment gateway with e-commerce site).
- Efficiency: Reuses existing services instead of reinventing the wheel.
- Scalability: Enables modular, flexible architectures.
- Innovation: Powers apps like weather forecasts, maps, social media integrations.

👉 Real-World Examples
• 	Payment: PayPal API lets apps process transactions.
• 	Travel: Airlines expose APIs for booking and flight status.
• 	Social Media: Facebook Graph API lets apps fetch posts, likes, and user data.
•   Used Google Maps API inside a food delivery app.
• 	Testing: Tools like Postman let you send requests to APIs to validate responses.

👉 Types of API:
1. Hardware API: Control hardware devices. Ex: camera api, printer api
2. Software/OS API: Interfaces to system-level functions, Ex: windows api, android api
3. Web API: Accessed via HTTP, often REST or GraphQL, Ex: Twitter API, Google Maps API

👉 API Architectures / Protocol Types
API Type        | Why It Matters for QA                                | Example in Testing
----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------
REST API        | Most common in modern apps; lightweight, JSON-based  | Validate login, CRUD operations, microservice endpoints
SOAP API        | Still used in legacy/enterprise systems; strict XML  | Test banking/insurance systems with WSDL contracts
GraphQL API     | Flexible queries; lets you fetch exactly what’s needed | Test e-commerce apps where you query product + inventory in one call
gRPC API        | High-performance, binary protocol; often in microservices | Test communication between backend services in CI/CD
WebSocket API   | Real-time, bidirectional communication               | Test chat apps, live dashboards, trading platforms

👉 What is a REST API?
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
- It’s an architectural style for designing web services.
- A REST API exposes resources (like users, books, orders) via URLs and lets clients interact with them using standard HTTP methods.

👉 Core Principles of REST
- Stateless
    - Each request from client → server must contain all the information needed.
    - The server doesn’t remember client state between requests.
- Resource-based
    - Everything is treated as a resource (user, product, order).
    - Each resource is identified by a unique URI (e.g., /users/123).
- Uniform Interface
    - Standard HTTP methods are used consistently:
        - GET → Retrieve data
        - POST → Create new resource
        - PUT → Replace existing resource
        - PATCH → Update part of a resource
        - DELETE → Remove resource
- Representation
    - Resources are usually represented in JSON (sometimes XML).
- Stateless + Cacheable
    - Responses can be cached to improve performance.

👉 POSTMAN:
- Postman is a popular API testing and collaboration tool that lets you send requests to APIs, inspect responses,
  and organize your testing workflows. It’s widely used by developers, testers, and QA engineers because it makes
  working with APIs much easier than writing raw curl commands or custom scripts.

👉 Collection in postman:
- A collection in Postman is basically a group of saved API requests that you can organize, reuse, and share.
  Think of it as a test suite or project folder for your API testing.

👉 API request methods:
- API request methods (also called HTTP methods or verbs). These define the type of action you want to perform
  on a resource in a REST API.

Method   | Purpose                          | Example                          | Notes
---------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
GET      | Retrieve data (read-only)        | GET /users/123                   | Safe, doesn’t change data
POST     | Create a new resource            | POST /users { "name": "Akash" }  | Non-idempotent (multiple calls create multiple records)
PUT      | Replace an existing resource     | PUT /users/123 { full user obj } | Idempotent (same request repeated → same result)
PATCH    | Update part of a resource        | PATCH /users/123 { "email": "new@mail.com" } | Partial update, more efficient
DELETE   | Remove a resource                | DELETE /users/123                | Idempotent (same request repeated → resource stays deleted)
HEAD     | Retrieve headers only            | HEAD /users/123                  | Useful for metadata, no body returned
OPTIONS  | Discover supported methods       | OPTIONS /users                   | Helpful for CORS and debugging

👉 HTTP status codes:
- HTTP status codes in APIs, we’re referring to the numeric codes returned by the server that indicate the
  result of your request.

Categories of HTTP Response Code:

Code Range | Category        | Meaning
-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------
1xx        | Informational   | Request received, continuing process
2xx        | Success         | Request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
3xx        | Redirection     | Further action needed (e.g., redirect to another URL)
4xx        | Client Error    | Problem with the request (bad input, unauthorized, not found)
5xx        | Server Error    | Problem on the server side

👉 Common Response Codes:

200   OK                    → Request succeeded (after GET)
201   Created               → A new resource was created successfully (after POST)
204   No Content            → Request succeeded but no body returned (often after DELETE)
301   Moved Permanently     → Resource moved to a new URL
302   Found                 → Temporary redirect
400   Bad Request           → Invalid request (syntax or parameters)
401   Unauthorized          → Authentication required or failed
403   Forbidden             → You don’t have permission
404   Not Found             → Requested resource could not be found. Resource or route doesn’t exist
409   Conflict              → Request conflicts with current state (e.g., duplicate record)
500   Internal Server Error → Generic server-side failure
502   Bad Gateway           → Invalid response from upstream server
503   Service Unavailable   → Server temporarily overloaded or down

👉 What is cURL?
- cURL stands for Client URL.
- It’s a command-line tool used to send requests to servers over URLs.
- Supports multiple protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, etc.
- Commonly used for API testing, debugging, and automation scripts.

👉 URI vs URL vs URN Cheat Sheet:

| Term    | Full Form                   | Definition                                                                                 | Example |
| **URI** | Uniform Resource Identifier | A string that uniquely identifies a resource on the web. It can be a URL or a URN.         | `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1` |
| **URL** | Uniform Resource Locator    | A type of URI that specifies the location of a resource (includes protocol, domain, path). | `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1` |
| **URN** | Uniform Resource Name       | A type of URI that names a resource without specifying its location.                       | `urn:isbn:0451450523` |

👉 What is an Endpoint?
- An endpoint is the specific path/URL where an API resource can be accessed.
- It’s the part of the URI that comes after the base URI.
- Think of it as the "door" to a particular function or resource in the API.

Example:
    Full URI: https://instagram.com/users/1/post
    - Base URI → https://instagram.com
    - Endpoint → /users/1/post

Types of Endpoints
- Collection endpoint → /users (returns all users)
- Single resource endpoint → /posts/1 (returns one user by ID)
- Action endpoint → /users/1/post (returns related data)

👉 Major Authentication Types in REST APIs
1. Basic Authentication:
 - How it works: Username and password are sent in the HTTP Authorization header, encoded in Base64.
 - Pros: Simple to implement.
 - Cons: Insecure if not used with HTTPS (credentials can be intercepted).
 - Use Case: Internal APIs, quick prototypes.
 - Rest Assured Example:
    given()
        .auth().basic("user", "password")
    .when()
        .get("/secure")
    .then()
        .statusCode(200);

2. API Keys:
 - How it works: A static key is passed in headers or query parameters.
 - Pros: Easy to implement, widely supported.
 - Cons: Keys can be leaked; no user identity, just application identity.
 - Use Case: Public APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Weather APIs).
 - Rest Assured Example:
    given()
        .header("x-api-key", "your_api_key")
    .when()
        .get("/data")
    .then()
        .statusCode(200);

3. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)
 - How it works: Server issues a signed token (JSON Web Token) after login. Client sends token in headers for subsequent requests.
 - Pros: Stateless, scalable, secure if implemented correctly.
 - Cons: Token theft can compromise security; requires careful expiry/refresh handling.
 - Use Case: Modern web/mobile apps, microservices.
 - Rest Assured Example:
    given()
        .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + jwtToken)
    .when()
        .get("/profile")
    .then()
        .statusCode(200);

4. OAuth 1.0
 - How it works: Uses consumer key/secret + access token/secret to sign requests.
 - Pros: Secure, request signing prevents tampering.
 - Cons: Complex, largely replaced by OAuth 2.0.
 - Use Case: Legacy APIs (Twitter used OAuth 1.0).
 - Rest Assured Example:
    given()
        .auth().oauth("consumerKey", "consumerSecret", "accessToken", "secretToken")
    .when()
        .get("/protected")
    .then()
        .statusCode(200);

5. OAuth 2.0
 - How it works: Uses access tokens (Bearer tokens) issued by an authorization server. Supports scopes, refresh tokens, delegated access.
 - Pros: Industry standard, flexible, secure.
 - Cons: More complex to implement.
 - Use Case: Modern APIs (Google, Facebook, GitHub).
 - Rest Assured Example:
    given()
        .auth().oauth2("access_token_here")
    .when()
        .get("/user")
    .then()
        .statusCode(200);

👉 Query Parameter:
- Query parameters are added at the end of the url to send extra information to the server.
- Key-value pairs appended to the URL after a ? to filter, sort, or modify the request.
- Usage: Used when the parameter is optional or filter, sort, or modify the result set.
- Format: /resource?key=value
- Example:
    GET /books?author=test&price=10
    - author=test and limit=10 are query parameters.

👉 Path Parameter:
- Definition: Values embedded directly in the URL path to identify a specific resource.
              - It tells the API which exact resource you want.
- Usage: Used when the parameter is essential to locate the resource.
- Format: /resource/{id}
- Example:
    GET /users/123/orders
    - 123 identifies the user.
    - give a list of orders collection of that user’s orders.
- you can use multiple path parameters in an API
  GET /users/123/orders/456

👉 Think of path parameters as the address of the house, while query parameters are the instructions for what you want inside
   the house (like sorting or filtering).
