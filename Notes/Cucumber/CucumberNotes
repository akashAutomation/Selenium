👉 Cucumber is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework that allows you to write test cases in
  plain English using a language called Gherkin. It bridges the gap between technical and non-technical
  stakeholders by making test scenarios readable and understandable by everyone involved in the development process.

👉 Cucumber keywords:
| Keyword           | Purpose                                                                 | Example Usage                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Feature           | Describes the high-level functionality being tested                     | Feature: User login functionality                  |
| Scenario          | Defines a specific test case or user behavior                           | Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials  |
| Given             | Sets up initial context or preconditions                                | Given the user is on the login page                |
| When              | Describes the action or event                                           | When the user enters valid credentials             |
| Then              | Specifies the expected outcome                                          | Then the user should be redirected to dashboard    |
| And               | Adds additional steps to Given, When, or Then                           | And the user clicks the login button               |
| But               | Adds a negative or contrasting step                                     | But the password field is empty                    |
| Background        | Defines common steps that run before each scenario in the feature       | Background: Given the user is logged in            |
| Scenario Outline  | Enables parameterized scenarios with examples                           | Scenario Outline: Login with <username>            |
| Examples          | Provides data table for Scenario Outline placeholders                   | | username | password |                            |
| Rule              | Groups related scenarios under a business rule (optional, advanced)     | Rule: Password must be at least 8 characters       |
| #                 | Comment line (ignored by Cucumber)                                      | # This scenario tests login failure                |

👉 Cucumber hooks:
- Cucumber hooks are special blocks of code that run before or after scenarios, steps, or features to manage setup,
  teardown, logging, and more. They help reduce code duplication and centralize test lifecycle logic.

| Hook Type             | Annotation       | When It Runs                                | Use Case Example                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Before                | @Before          | Before each scenario                         | Launch browser, initialize WebDriver, set test data    |
| After                 | @After           | After each scenario                          | Quit browser, capture screenshot on failure            |
| BeforeStep            | @BeforeStep      | Before each step in a scenario               | Log step start, set up preconditions                   |
| AfterStep             | @AfterStep       | After each step in a scenario                | Log step result, capture screenshot on failure         |
| BeforeAll (Java 8+)   | @BeforeAll       | Once before all scenarios (static method)    | Global setup like DB connection or config loading      |
| AfterAll (Java 8+)    | @AfterAll        | Once after all scenarios (static method)     | Global teardown like closing DB or flushing reports    |

👉 Cucumber Exception
| Exception Type                     | Description                                                                 | Typical Cause                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| UndefinedStepException            | Step in feature file has no matching definition                            | Missing or misnamed step definition                     |
| AmbiguousStepException            | Multiple step definitions match a single step                              | Overlapping regex or duplicate step definitions         |
| CucumberException                 | Generic Cucumber error                                                      | Misconfigured runner, glue paths, or feature files      |
| MissingStepDefinitionException    | Step definition not found during dry run                                   | Step not implemented or glue path incorrect             |
| DuplicateStepDefinitionException  | Same step defined more than once                                            | Copy-paste errors or overlapping regex                  |

| PendingException                  | Step marked as pending (e.g., throw new PendingException())                | Placeholder for unimplemented step                      |


👉 TestRunner file:
- The TestRunner file is the control center of your Cucumber framework. It tells Cucumber where to find features, which steps to use,
  what reports to generate, and how to display output.

1. @RunWith(Cucumber.class):
  - Tells JUnit to run this class using the Cucumber runner.
  - Without this, JUnit won’t know how to execute feature files

2. @CucumberOptions
    This annotation configures how Cucumber runs. Key options:
- features
    Path to your .feature files.
    Example: "src/test/resources/features"
- glue
    Package(s) containing your step definitions.
    Example: {"stepDefinitions"}
- tags
    Run only scenarios with specific tags.
    Example: "@SmokeTest" runs only smoke tests.
            You can combine: "@Regression and not @Ignore"
- plugin
    Defines report formats. Common plugins:
    - "pretty" → readable console output
    - "html:target/cucumber-reports.html" → HTML report
    - "json:target/cucumber.json" → JSON report (for CI/CD tools like Jenkins)
- monochrome
    - true → Console output is clean, no special characters/colors.
    - false → Output may include ANSI colors/symbols.
- dryRun
    - true → Checks if all steps in feature files have matching step definitions (without executing actual tests).
    - false → Runs the actual tests normally.

3. Class Declaration
    public class TestRunner {
    }
    - Empty class body because all configuration is handled by annotations.
    - Acts as the entry point for running Cucumber tests
    Normally it’s empty, but you might add code if:
    - You override methods in AbstractTestNGCucumberTests (e.g., for parallel execution).
    - You add custom hooks or listeners.
    - You integrate with reporting frameworks beyond the plugins

4. AbstractTestNGCucumberTests :
    - This is a base class provided by the Cucumber-TestNG integration library.
    - When your TestRunner extends it, Cucumber scenarios are automatically mapped into TestNG test methods.
    - This allows you to use TestNG features like:
        - Parallel execution
        - Test grouping
        - Advanced reporting
        - Integration with CI/CD tools

👉 DataTable:
Data Tables in Cucumber are a powerful way to pass structured data from your .feature file into step definitions.
They’re especially useful when you want to avoid hardcoding multiple values or when you need tabular input.

When to Use Data Tables
- When you want structured input for a single step.
- When you need to pass multiple values without creating a Scenario Outline.
- When you want to keep data visible in the feature file but avoid duplication.

Way to convert datatable:
- Use List for single-column tables(List<String>).
- Use List of Lists or Maps for multi-column tables(List<List<String>> OR List<Map<String, String>>).
Example:
    1. List<String> list = dataTable.asLists(String.class); --> for single-column tables
    1. List<List<String>> list = dataTable.asLists(String.class); --> multi-column tables
    2. List<Map<String, String>> users = dataTable.asMaps(String.class, String.class); --> multi-column tables



👉 TestNG Data Provider integration using cucumber:
    @Override
    @DataProvider(parallel = true)
    public Object[][] scenarios() {
        return super.scenarios();
    }

1. Object[][]
    - This is a two‑dimensional array of Objects.
    - Each inner array (Object[]) represents one set of parameters for a test run.
    - In this case, each row corresponds to one Cucumber scenario that TestNG will execute.
2. scenarios() method
    - Defined in AbstractTestNGCucumberTests.
    - It provides all the scenarios from your .feature files to TestNG as data sets.
    - By overriding it, you can customize how scenarios are supplied (e.g., enable parallel execution).
3. return super.scenarios();
    - Calls the parent class (AbstractTestNGCucumberTests) implementation.
    - That method already knows how to collect all scenarios from your Cucumber feature files.
    - So you’re simply reusing the parent’s logic instead of writing your own.
4. @DataProvider(parallel = true)
    - Marks this method as a TestNG DataProvider.
    - Each row of Object[][] is fed into the test runner as one execution.
    - parallel = true means multiple scenarios can run concurrently in separate threads, speeding up execution.
