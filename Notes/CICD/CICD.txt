👉 Continuous Integration (CI)
- Definition: Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository.
- Automation: Each commit triggers automated builds and tests.
- Goal: Catch bugs early, ensure code integrates smoothly, and maintain a working build at all times.
- Example:
    - Developer pushes code → Jenkins/GitHub Actions runs mvn test → Test results published.
    - If tests fail, the pipeline blocks deployment until fixed.

👉 Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Definition: Ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and prepared for release.
- Deployment: The software is always in a deployable state, but release to production may still require manual approval.
              It requires to clicking on button to deploy as it requires manual intervention.
- Goal: Shorten release cycles, reduce risk, and make deployments routine.
- Example:
    - After CI passes, artifacts are packaged and deployed to a staging environment.
    - Ops team can approve and push to production.

👉 Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Definition: Extends Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying every successful build to production without manual intervention.
- Goal: Deliver features to users quickly and continuously.
- Example:
    - Code passes CI → Automatically deployed to production servers.
    - Users see new features immediately.

| Aspect               | Continuous Integration (CI) | Continuous Delivery (CD) | Continuous Deployment (CD) |
|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Focus**            | Code integration + testing   | Ready-to-deploy builds    | Automatic production release |
| **Automation Level** | Build + test                 | Build + test + package    | Build + test + deploy        |
| **Manual Step?**     | No                          | Yes (approval step)       | No                          |
